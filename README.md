# HiLo-Fish

This is the data analysis for Jill Campbell's MSc chapter that complements the HiLo analysis for Sharon Jeffrey. This analysis examines the effect of current and other abiotic factors on fish abundnace, biomass and diversity at different sites in the Gulf Islands. THe data was collected slightly differently thant the invertebrate data so the the number of points and sites differ betweent the two studies. This project also invovles collaboration with Sharon Jeffery, Sarah Dudas and Francis Juanes. My main role is to help guide the analyses.
